<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hey! I'm a 15 year old boy who is really into coding. I want to be a Full
  Stack Web Developer one day. Inorder to pursue my goal I started taking a full
  stack web development course in Udemy and I am learning throught it everyday.
</p>
<p>
  I have alot of free time as I just completed my 10th grade board exams so I
  have summer vacations for 2 months now and I am planning on completing this
  course by the end of these vacations.
</p>
<p>
  I am learning through Dr. Angela Yu and I gotta say she is a wonderful and
  fantastic teacher! Her way of teaching is really simple and I am able to grasp
  the concept as I watch the Video itself. So yeah that's all about me! If you
  want to know anything else then feel free to contact me!
